    <p><span class="big">Tomorrow when the farm boys find this freak of nature,</span>they will wrap his body in newspaper and carry him to the museum.</p>
    <p>
      But tonight he is alive <span class="big">and in the north field with his mother.</span>.
     </p>
       It is a perfect summer evening:  the wind in the grass.
    <p>
       <span class="big">the moon rising over the orchard,</span> the wind in the grass.

    </p>
       <p>And as he stares into the sky, <span class="big">new life</span></p>
    <p><span id="boldly">there are twice as many stars as usual.</p>
